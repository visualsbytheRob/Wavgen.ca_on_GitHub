# Wavgen.ca Codebase Commenting Project — Teaching Reference Summary

**Project Goal:**
Systematically add comprehensive, beginner-friendly comments to every meaningful line of code across all files in the Wavgen.ca Eleventy-based website codebase, creating a detailed teaching reference for future maintenance and learning.

---

## Scope & Approach
- **Every file** (templates, scripts, CSS, config, docs, data) was reviewed and commented.
- **Native comment style** used for each language (Nunjucks `{# ... #}`, JS `//` or `/* ... */`, CSS `/* ... */`, Markdown `<!-- ... -->`).
- **Teaching blocks** added at the top of each major file, explaining structure and purpose.
- **Every meaningful line or block** is commented for clarity, with repeated structures commented in detail only once and a note for analogous sections.
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** provided throughout, assuming minimal coding background.
- **Large generated files** (e.g., Tailwind CSS output) are explained with a teaching block, and all custom code is commented.

---

## Files & Sections Covered
- **Nunjucks templates/content pages:** All main and subpages, with teaching blocks and detailed comments on unique structures.
- **JavaScript:** `main.js`, `server.js`, and data files — all logic commented.
- **Media Players:** `music-player.js`, `video-player.js` — comprehensive educational comments covering ES6 classes, third-party API integration, DOM manipulation, error handling, and professional streaming integration patterns.
- **GSAP Gallery System:** `gallery.js` — extensively documented gallery system with hero slideshow, hero background slideshow, infinite marquee carousel, and unified modal gallery. Includes detailed comments on GSAP animations, event handling, responsive design, and dual slideshow architecture.
- **Interactive Code Playground:** `code-playground.js` — comprehensive educational system with Monaco Editor integration, featuring four interactive modes (Tailwind CSS, GSAP Animations, Eleventy Templates, Site Code Snippets). Includes detailed comments on VS Code editor integration, vertical stack layout design for mobile optimization, real-time preview systems, safe code execution, mobile touch handling, and educational UI patterns with responsive design principles.
- **CSS:** `input.css`, `style.css` — teaching blocks clarify Tailwind vs. custom code, all custom classes commented.
- **Config:** `.eleventy.js`, `tailwind.config.js` — all sections explained.
- **Documentation:** All Markdown docs (`docs/`), with HTML teaching comments.
- **Data:** `_data/navigation.js` — teaching block and expanded comments on the first section.
- **Layouts & Includes:** `_layouts/base.njk`, `_includes/navigation.njk`, `_includes/footer.njk` — all commented for structure and intent.

---

## Key Decisions
- **Focus on clarity and teaching:** Comments explain both the "what" and the "why" for each line or block.
- **No code execution impact:** Comments are placed so as not to interfere with code or template rendering.
- **Systematic, complete coverage:** No file or directory with meaningful logic was left uncommented.

---

## Result
This codebase is now a comprehensive, beginner-friendly teaching reference. Every meaningful line, block, and file is explained for future learning, onboarding, and maintenance. If new files are added or further review is needed, this approach can be continued.
