        <h3>Project Structure:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSS and Styling:</strong> The <code>css</code> directory contains the main stylesheet, <code>wavgen.css</code>, which defines the look and feel of the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Images:</strong> The <code>images</code> directory holds various assets, including a parallax background and some unique toe images.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The <code>js</code> directory includes scripts for loading components and animations, with GSAP plugins enhancing interactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> The <code>components</code> directory has subnav files for different sections like art, data, music, and videos, helping organize the site's navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Main HTML Files:</strong> <code>index.html</code> is your starting point, while <code>indexbackup.html</code> serves as a backup. There's also a <code>404.html</code> for error handling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
        <p>Since you've already cloned the project, dive into the <code>index.html</code> to see how the site is structured. Explore the <code>components</code> directory to understand how different sections are organized. If you're interested in animations, check out the GSAP scripts in the <code>js</code> directory.</p>

        <h3>Contributing:</h3>
        <p>Feel free to experiment with the styles in <code>wavgen.css</code> or add new features using JavaScript. You can also enhance the content in the subnav files or create new sections. Rob is keen on learning and integrating new tools, so any innovative ideas or improvements are welcome!</p>
