title: Codebase commenting project summary
date: 2025-08-24

- Scope: every meaningful line across templates, JS, CSS, config, docs, and data is commented for teaching clarity.
- Native comment styles: Nunjucks `{# ... #}`, JS `//` and `/* ... */`, CSS `/* ... */`, Markdown `<!-- ... -->`.
- Teaching blocks at file tops explain structure, purpose, and decisions.
- Heavily documented systems:
  - GSAP gallery (hero slideshows, background slideshow, infinite marquee, modal gallery).
  - Media players (SoundCloud, YouTube) with robust UX and error handling patterns.
  - Interactive Code Playground (Monaco) with 4 learning modes.
- Result: a beginnerâ€‘friendly, maintainable, and pedagogically strong codebase.
