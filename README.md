## 📚 Code Commenting & Teaching Philosophy

This repo is a model for code clarity:
- **Every meaningful line is commented** in its native style (see [CODEBASE_COMMENTING_SUMMARY.md](CODEBASE_COMMENTING_SUMMARY.md)).
- **Teaching blocks** at the top of each file explain structure and intent.
- **Repeated sections** are commented once in detail, with notes for analogous code.
- **GSAP gallery system** — extensively documented with animation explanations, event handling, and integration notes.
- **No code execution impact** — comments are safe for production.
