# Wavgen.ca on Github

This is the GitHub repo I am using to publish my site wavgen.ca.
My first commit was on January 15th 2022, which was the first time I ever used Github to build a website.
Having first learned to create a website in the 1990's using tools like Macromedia Dreamweaver and reading Orielly books,
starting with Html and over the years, exploring CSS and JavaScript with minor dabbling in programming.
My most recent website was built, using WordPress and the elementor plugin which was good to make a nice looking site.
Having decided to discontinue that site my focus on this one is to see how far you can go with Github pages and a domain.
I also intend to use all of the tools available these days to learn programming and integrations.
This includes Artificial Intelligence tools like code assistants and finding ways to embed components, hosted elsewhere, like on hugging face or Vercel.
Most of the websites I have created before have been just presentations of content this one I want to explore more web development.
Other interests I have are Quantum and Cloud Computing, Real-time Generative 3D AV and Visual Art which will help feed the projects content.
It seems to me like GitHub is the perfect place to do this and part of the objective is to do as much as possible as inexpensively as possible.
Here's to the adventure of exploring the possibilities together.
