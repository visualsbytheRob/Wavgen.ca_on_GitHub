This is the GitHub repo I am using to publish my site wavgen.ca
My first commit was on January 15th 2022, which was the first time I ever used Github to build a website
First learning to create a website in the 1990's using tools like Macromedia Dreamweaver and reading Orielly books
Starting with Html and over the years, exploring CSS and JavaScript and a little PHP
My most recent website was built, using WordPress and the elementor plugin which good to make a nice looking site
Having decided to discontinue that site and focus on this one with the main objective to see how far you can go with Github pages and a domain
I also intend to use all of the tools available these days to learn programming and integrations 
This includes AI tools like code assistance and finding ways to embed components, hosted elsewhere, like on hugging face or Vercel
Most of the websites have created before have been just presentations of content this one I want to explore more coding 
It seems to me like GitHub is the perfect place to do this and part of the objective is to do as much as possible as inexpensively as possible 
Here's to the adventure of exploring the possibilities together
