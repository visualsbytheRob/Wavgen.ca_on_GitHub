## 🚀 About This Project

**Wavgen.ca** is a modern, meticulously crafted portfolio and creative technology playground by [Rob McDonald](https://github.com/robmcdonald) — a digital pioneer, artist, and developer based in Toronto. This site is more than a showcase: it is a living reference for web development, creative coding, and the intersection of music, art, data, and technology.

- **Fully open-source, Eleventy-powered static site** — fast, accessible, and easy to extend.
- **Comprehensive, beginner-friendly code comments** — every meaningful line and block is explained for learning and onboarding.
- **Professional, creative, and playful design** — purple/yellow theme, satirical "10x Developer Stack™", and unique sections.
- **Responsive, accessible navigation** — desktop dropdowns, mobile hamburger menu, and smooth user experience.
- **Showcases work in Music, Video, Data & Tech, and Art** — each with 4 balanced, thoughtfully designed subsections.
- **Advanced integrations** — ready for AI, cloud, and real-time generative art.

## 📚 Code Commenting & Teaching Philosophy

This repo is a model for code clarity:
- **Every meaningful line is commented** in its native style (see [CODEBASE_COMMENTING_SUMMARY.md](CODEBASE_COMMENTING_SUMMARY.md)).
- **Teaching blocks** at the top of each file explain structure and intent.
- **Repeated sections** are commented once in detail, with notes for analogous code.
- **No code execution impact** — comments are safe for production.
